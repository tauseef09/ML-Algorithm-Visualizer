# ML Algorithm Visualizer
Visualizing machine learning algorithms with interactive hyper-parameters and multiple datasets. The algorithms that are visualized:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Non Linear Support Vector Machine
- K means
- Naive Bayes
- Decison Tree
- Principal Component Analysis

## Getting Started
### Creating an environment
**Using Anaconda**
```
conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.7
```
Where `ENV_NAME` is the name of the environment. After creating the environment, activate it using:
```
conda activate ENV_NAME
```
**Using venv**
```
//windows
python3 -m venv ENV_NAME
```
Where `ENV_NAME` is the name of the environment. After creating the environment, activate it using:
```
source ENV_NAME/bin/activate
```
### Installing requirements
Install all the requirements from `requirements.txt` using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the program
Open the `Visualizer.ipynb` and run all cells.
